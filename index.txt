Hello, my name is Chandler Wright, I am in section 2 and my instructor is Dr. Case

I'm studying to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science and am technically a senior. I transferred into  NWMSU a year and a half ago. I have completed all of my gen-ed courses and am now just fulfilling my degree required courses.

I grew up in a suburb outside of Kansas City, KS and went to a community college there. I received an Associate's Degree in Video Game Development with a specialty on the programming side. I play a lot of video games, especially with everything that's going on preventing me to go outside. I enjoy disc golf and Ultimate Frisbee. I also enjoy fishing.

I hope to go into software development. Video game development would be my career of choice but I would be happy with a job in consumer/business software development as well. 

Growing up I became very close friends with someone who is deaf so I taught myself sign language so we could communicate without having to have an interpreter around.
